This module is a division function

Usage
=====
``matrix_divided(...)`` returns a new matrix

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [
	...	[2, 4, 6],
	...	[8, 10, 12]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

all element should be rounded to two decimal places

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[2, 3, 4],
	...	[5, 6, 1]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.67, 1.0, 1.33], [1.67, 2.0, 0.33]]

the original matrix must be left unchanged

::

	>>> print(matrix)
	[[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 1]]

the matrix can be a list of floats

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[2.2, 4.4, 6.6],
	...	[8.8, 1.2, 0.4]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	[[1.1, 2.2, 3.3], [4.4, 0.6, 0.2]]

raise TypeError if matrix is not a list of lists

::

	>>> matrix = "school"
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

	>>> matrix = []
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

	>>> matrix = [[]]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	[[]]

::

	>>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

all elements must be integers or floats

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[2, 4, "school"],
	...	[6, 2, 4]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

all rows of matrix must be same size

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[2, 4, 6, 8],
	...	[1, 4, 8]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

div must be an integer or float

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 4],
	...	[6, 8, 9]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "school"))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

div must be greater than 0
::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 4, 2],
	...	[6, 7, 8]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
